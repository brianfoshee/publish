      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to Europe for 4 months in 2018 as part of my <a href="/blog/im-taking-a-year-off">year off</a>. While I was
there I shot a bunch of <a href="/px">pictures</a> and videos, the latter of which I&rsquo;m
finally going through. My summary of the whole trip is now up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wr4ysHaOJo">on my YouTube

      <title>30</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/turning-30</link>
      <description>Today is my 30th birthday.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I turned 28 it occured to me for the first time that 30 was about to
happen. The thought of that stressed me out for a minute. Had I done everything
I needed to do in my 20s? Was I ready for whatever being in my 30s means? Am I
getting old?</p>

<p>My 20s were, taken as a whole, great. Sure, I had some difficult years, but I
pushed through a lot of internal struggles, I figured out and became confident
in who I am, I realized what my priorities currently are in life, I learned from
many failures and successes, I made the best group of friends who support me and
hold me accountable, and I built a solid career foundation.</p>

<p>After giving it more thought, I realized that turning 30 would give me a chance to
focus in on what&rsquo;s important to me.</p>

<p>And 30 isn&rsquo;t old.</p>

<p>I became content with turning 30. Excited, even. And then I decided to <a href="/blog/why-im-taking-a-year-off">take an
entire year off</a> to make sure that my 30s begin strong and that I have the
time to reflect on where I&rsquo;ve been, take the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned from my
journey so far, and set myself on a path to make the first few years of my 30s
fruitful (I would say all of my 30s but I have a hard time planning more than a
few years ahead, if I can even decide what to do tomorrow or next week.)</p>

<p>My 20s were more or less doing the &lsquo;usual&rsquo;: go to college, figure out a career,
figure out how to be an adult and on my own. Thirty is a blank canvas to paint,
a new chapter to write, new problems to solve.</p>

<p>Today is my 30th birthday. I&rsquo;m spending it on the beautiful island of Kefalonia,
Greece, on a secluded beach, under the sun, looking out at the blue and green
water that you can see right through. Which is exactly where I wanted to be
today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve given myself a giant birthday present in this trip around Europe and this
year off in general. I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with the decision.  Who knows
what the next few years will look like, but I&rsquo;m excited about what I&rsquo;ve taken
away from the thinking and reflecting that I&rsquo;ve done during the last six months
of not working.</p>

      <title>Grandmama Sara</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/grandmama-sara</link>
      <description>Grandmama left us to be with Grandaddy today</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer I got to spend time with Grandmama right before Grandaddy passed
away and before I left for Europe. For a while we sat on the covered porch where
she lived because she wanted to be outside. Not much was said, but the memories
I have of her were present and that was enough.</p>

<p>Grandmama Sara’s Summer Camp - the one week every summer that she wrangled her 9
grandchildren together - provided so many experiences that contributed to making
me who I am (including my sweet tooth - she never said no to us eating candy or
drinking bottomless Yoo-hoos).</p>

<p>Each summer she showed us her world, where she lived and worked and grew up, the
people she knew, and people she didn&rsquo;t know but could somehow talk into letting
her bring a rowdy group of cousins to their factory/business/etc to learn
something new. She taught us about family, work, and responsibility. She seemed
to have an endless amount of energy to deal with us, and never missed scratching
our backs and singing us a song before we fell asleep each night.</p>

<p>Grandmama went to be with Grandaddy today. I’m thankful for all of the time
I had with them, I’m sad they’re gone and I&rsquo;ll miss them both dearly, but I know
they’ll continue to cheer us on from wherever they are. ❤️</p>

      <title>I Went Off-Grid For One Week</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/one-week-off-grid</link>
      <description>I turned off my computer and phone for a week to reboot my technology habits.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 10 years I have worked and played on a computer for 8+ hours a day,
leaving little room for much else while not always accomplishing anything. My
cellphone became something I would reach for first thing in the morning, in the
middle of the night if I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, or when I had any idle moment.</p>

<p>I began my <a href="/blog/why-im-taking-a-year-off">year off</a> by spending one week away from these devices that I&rsquo;ve
become so accustomed to using all day, every day.</p>

<p>While my year off is a reboot of my lifestyle, my week off-grid was a reboot of
my use of technology. I <a href="/about">make a living off of technology</a>, but the
always-available nature of the internet allowed me to get into unhealthy usage
habits like checking email multiple times a day, reading websites that haven&rsquo;t
changed in the five minutes since I last read them, or taking my phone out of my
pocket to fill time that would be better spent interacting with the people
around me or reading a book or writing or reflecting on the moment. Backing away
from screens would hopefully allow me to be more present and focused.</p>

<p>On the night before I began this week off-grid, I powered off my laptop and my
cellphone. For 7 days they sat on my dresser, unused. I also did not watch any
TV during this time. Instead I planned to read, write, walk, and be outside. My
parents were around for 5 of the 7 days, so I wasn&rsquo;t in complete isolation, and
they were nice enough to not turn on the TV or talk about current events. I also
told some close friends about my plans so they knew what I was up to.</p>

<p>As the week unfolded I felt more focused when doing one thing at a time. I spent
a lot of time sitting outside and thinking about nothing. It was so refreshing.
My head was clear. I stopped reaching for my phone that wasn&rsquo;t there. I was
enjoying being disconnected.</p>

<p>I journaled each night before going to bed. I was at a lake house so I strung
up my hammock on the dock for a reading/thinking/napping spot. The background
noise of birds chirping, water flowing, boats passing, and the occasional rain
storm on the metal roof set a relaxing mood.</p>

<p>When my parents and I went to a friend&rsquo;s graduation party, I felt much more
engaged with those around me. Even when I wasn&rsquo;t talking to anyone I could sit
with my own thoughts and be happy.</p>

<p>It took 4 days until I had a strong urge to get my phone out and look things up.
Luckily that day I had some house work to do to keep me active.</p>

<p>As the end of the week neared, I felt like I was getting what I wanted from the
experience. I also started to miss my friends! The wonderful thing about the
internet is how connected we can be to the people we love no matter how far away
they are. It&rsquo;s no substitute for connecting in-person, but as I travel around I
enjoy being able to talk to my family and friends from wherever I am. It makes
them seem a little closer even though I&rsquo;m (currently) an ocean away.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no escaping the fact that I need my computer and the internet to write
software and make a living. I love making things - software or <a href="/blog">blogs</a> or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCnxocnbh74guQll8yqWGUA">videos</a> or <a href="/px">pictures</a> - and my computer is the tool that usually helps me
with that. I also enjoy seeing what others have created or learning something
new, often on social media or around the internet.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also no denying the utility of a smartphone. I can navigate around a
foreign city, pay my credit card bill, transfer money into my checking account
when I need to use an ATM, and send my travel partner my half of a dinner bill,
all from a device that fits in my pocket. I can also endlessly scroll through
Instagram and Twitter, check and re-check the same websites, and feel a
compulsion to talk to people through that device instead of enjoying whatever
moment I am experiencing.</p>

<p>Hopefully by stripping out all of the excess and unnecessary usage of my phone
and computer I can re-learn to use them only for necessary utility and for
creating. And when I don&rsquo;t need to do either I can choose to do something else
like read or be active or meet someone new or do nothing.</p>

<p>Am I perfectly cured of my bad technology habits? No. But going off-grid for a
week made me more aware of them and one by one I&rsquo;m working to change them. I&rsquo;ve
removed all social media apps from my phone, in favor of logging into
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianfoshee/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/brianfoshee">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCnxocnbh74guQll8yqWGUA">YouTube</a> on my laptop. This helps me to
limit my usage to once a day or less, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to take my
phone out nearly as much. I&rsquo;ve been able to keep myself from unnecessarily
checking websites throughout the day, and I&rsquo;m trying to use the web browser only
when I really need to look up travel info.</p>

<p>I find that it&rsquo;s important to learn how to slow down, and to make sure that the
things I&rsquo;m doing are important to me instead of them being habit or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how
it&rsquo;s always been done.&rdquo; Going off-grid gave me a clear head to see what my
priorities are, and in the time since then I&rsquo;ve been working on clearing out
what&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>I will absolutely go off-grid again, and likely will do it at least once more
during this year off.</p>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Taking a Year Off</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/why-im-taking-a-year-off</link>
      <description>Throughout my 20s I mostly focused on my career; I&#39;m taking a year off to focus on myself.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written various forms of this post as journal entries over the last 18
months. The first was 17 January 2017 (yes, 2017) when I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided to take a one year sabbatical beginning 1 June 2018. The timing
is such that it&rsquo;ll take place during the last 6 months of my 20s and the first 6
months of my 30s. This will signify in many ways a transition into my 30s and
will set my pace of life for the following few years. I don&rsquo;t yet have an idea
as to exactly what I&rsquo;ll do on this break, but I do know that I&rsquo;d like to take
the time to refocus my life and make sure I&rsquo;m living every aspect of it as I
want to instead of how I think other people think I should.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My decision to <a href="/blog/im-taking-a-year-off">take a year off</a> was gut instinct. I&rsquo;ve learned to
trust my gut instinct because it&rsquo;s usually right, no matter how difficult it may
be to accept or act on what needs to be done. I remember the feeling of making
this particular decision. It was refreshing - powerful, almost - to be able to
step out of the norm of my life and get back to where my heart has been for a
while. And being four months into it now, I can say that it was the right
decision.</p>

<p>I have wanted to take some sort of break since my final two years of college (I
was there for six years). I worked all through college, first as an intern at an
architectural testing firm and then writing software for a startup, and was
burnt out. I wanted to do nothing for a few months. To recharge. But I hadn&rsquo;t
saved up enough money to be able to do that so I pushed through and put the
idea on the back burner.</p>

<p>A couple of years after I graduated from college I hit a low point, and through
that did a lot of growing up and learning about life. I made career and
financial goals to work towards in the second half of my 20s. I met those goals
and did things that I had no idea were possible back when I made them, but I
felt like something was missing. I hadn&rsquo;t really taken care of myself.</p>

<p>While I spent the whole of my 20s investing in and building my career, I didn&rsquo;t
do much to invest in myself personally. I wasn&rsquo;t taking care of my mind and body
and spirit as much as I should have been. Now that I&rsquo;m in a position to cash in
on my career investments and get a year&rsquo;s worth of work weeks to myself, I am
making me a priority.</p>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m doing the things that make me happy, push me out of my comfort
zone, make me active, and get me ready for my 30s.</p>

      <title>A Terrible Weekend On The Lake</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/a-terrible-weekend-on-the-lake</link>
      <description>A man drowned near my family&#39;s lake house and I was there to experience the event and the recovery effort.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quick preface/disclaimer/warning: I put this post together from a few of my
journal entries. They were written in near real-time while I was experiencing
the death of a man who I didn&rsquo;t know. He died near my family&rsquo;s lake house last
weekend, where I&rsquo;ve been spending this summer.</p>

<h3>Saturday, 9 June 2018</h3>

<p>Saturday started out like any other day. I woke up around 9:30A.M., took a
shower, ate breakfast, and read in my hammock on the dock. After eating a late
lunch I went back down to the dock to shave my head. When I got there I noticed
a massive storm sitting over the lake to the north and west. It began thundering
so I went back up to the house. My brother Price and I started planning his
bachelor weekend.</p>

<p>The sky darkened with clouds as the storm made its way south. The wind picked up
and was blowing off the lake, towards our house. There were whitecaps on the lake
and our windows rattled with a few gusts of wind. Waves were breaking onto the dock.
Lightning was flashing on the far side of the lake. It wasn&rsquo;t raining.</p>

<p>Price and I looked out the windows and noticed that two boats - a pontoon boat
and a speedboat - were meeting a pair of kayakers out on the lake, maybe 100
yards off our dock. The pontoon boat floated between us and the kayaks, blocking
our view of them. This was all far enough away that we couldn&rsquo;t see what was
going on, so Price got our binoculars. I could see people on the boats, and the
two kayaks were vertical and mostly underwater. The boats were floating north
and neither seemed to have their engine turned on. But nobody was trying to get
the kayaks. Or the paddles. There were life jackets in the water. There wasn&rsquo;t
anybody else on the lake. Something seemed off.</p>

<p>Price walked down to our dock when the boats floated out of eyesight (some of
our trees block the view to the north, so we couldn&rsquo;t see anything after the
boats floated past our neighbor&rsquo;s dock.) Melinda, our neighbor to the south,
walked over to meet him. After a minute or two I heard sirens. As I walked down
to the dock, Price was running up to the road to meet the firetruck.</p>

<p>When I got to the dock Melinda looked very concerned. She told me that she
thought someone went under. That took me a second to process, but there wasn&rsquo;t
any time to think on it because the two boats were driving towards our dock.</p>

<p>The speedboat arrived first, on the north side of our dock. On board was a
woman, her brother, and three children. The man helped to keep the boat from
slamming into the dock, as the wind and waves had not calmed down. I helped the
three kids and the woman off the boat. I took down my hammock so it wasn&rsquo;t in
the way.</p>

<p>The pontoon boat arrived next with two young couples and a woman on board. Price
helped tie it up to the front of the dock. The woman got off first, crying and
in shock. Another woman got off and looked at me with the widest eyes, a look
that I won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p>

<p>The first woman was met by an EMT who walked her to an ambulance. She and her
husband had fallen off their kayaks and into the water. Her husband drowned.</p>

<p>At this point the firefighters had arrived on our dock. One of them got in the
speedboat to go back out to where the man drowned. An ambulance was parked in
Melinda&rsquo;s driveway. Police officers arrived in plain clothes because they had
all been enjoying the weekend and were not on duty.</p>

<p>Slowly more and more emergency personnel showed up. The Sheriff. His lieutenant
and deputies. More firefighters. More officers. They took our statements. Price
and I put folding chairs out for the two couples who were in the pontoon boat.</p>

<p>The two kayakers had been out on the lake for the day. They were on the far side of
the lake when the storm began rolling in. They decided to make their way to the
other side of the lake - where our house is, and near where they had put the
kayaks in - which is almost a mile across. Neither had a life jacket on, and
neither knew how to swim well. They were panicking and paddling hard.</p>

<p>They flagged down two boats when they were about 3/4s of the way across. A wave
knocked him out of his kayak. He grabbed her kayak, flipping her out. The people
in the pontoon boat threw all of their life jackets towards him. He wouldn&rsquo;t put
one on. He was panicking. They got her onto the boat. When they went back to get
him he was gone. This all happened in the moments before Price and I looked
through binoculars to see the kayaks vertical in the water.</p>

<p>The emergency personnel cleared everyone off our dock. Sheriff Hancock asked
Price and I if they could use our dock and our yard and we said of course. The
dive team showed up and used the pontoon boat, which was a rental. Boats from
the Department of Natural Resources were gridding the search area with sonar.
Off-duty police officers who were on their personal fishing boats joined in the
search.</p>

<p>I walked up to the house to calm down and drink some water. I started writing.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re currently still searching. It&rsquo;s 7:09 PM. He went under at probably
4:00P.M.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light rain began.</p>

<p>I met Mercedes. She was in the speedboat. I helped her and the three kids off
when they got to our dock.</p>

<p>I met Zach, he went kayaking with him three weeks ago.</p>

<p>I met her cousin. She was thankful we let the family sit on our porch, which was
out of eyesight of the <a href="http://www.walb.com/story/38391166/missing-kayakers-body-found">local media</a> who had arrived.</p>

<p>Police tape was strung across our yard and into Melinda&rsquo;s yard, on the side of
our house facing the road. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Command Center RV was parked in our
driveway. The dive team&rsquo;s pickup truck was parked in our yard by the dock.</p>

<p>The young couples that were on the pontoon boat were brought back to the marina
where they rented it from to get their car. We&rsquo;ve since only spoken to them via
text message.</p>

<p>The dive team packed up after sunset, around 9P.M. They’ll be back at 6:30A.M.
Price and I walked down to our dock, which was quiet except for the boats still
gridding nearby. Two police officers were there. They told us at least one will
be there all night. The rental pontoon boat was tied up to the end of our dock.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep well that night. I was mostly up thinking through too many what-if
scenarios.</p>

<h3>Sunday, 10 June 2018</h3>

<p>Price and I went for a walk, maybe around 10A.M. When we were out we heard and
then saw a helicopter flying up and down the shoreline of the lake and then back
to the search area off our dock. It was the Georgia State Patrol, who were
called in to assist in the search. We were out for about an hour. On our way
back in we could see the enormity of the recovery effort. In addition to the
Sheriff&rsquo;s Command Center, there were at least five other vehicles in our front
yard and another five down by our dock. A fire truck was parked on the street.
Across the street were at least ten vehicles. A few media vehicles were parked
along the street. A tent was setup near the Command Center with food and drinks.</p>

<p>I met Jason, his brother. He arrived late at night and slept in his car in
our driveway.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t fully processed the situation, so instead of sitting inside I walked
over to Melinda&rsquo;s to talk to her and her husband, Eddy. I watched the
helicopter flying directly overhead. I watched the boats on the water, the
divers in the water, the people all over our dock and our yard. I met a county
commissioner and some folks from the Sheriff&rsquo;s office who I talked with for a
while.</p>

<p>A cadaver dog arrived and went out on a boat. I’m not sure how that works but I
believe it&rsquo;s trained to bark if it smells a human. Since there were other
boaters out on the lake the dog&rsquo;s senses were thrown off and it was barking
quite a bit. The dog was biting at the water that went past the boat, which is
something our family dog used to do.</p>

<p>I spent four or five hours on Eddy and Melinda&rsquo;s dock. The Sheriff came over to
chat at one point. It was after 9P.M. when they called off the search for the
day. Price and I went back up to the house, and to take our minds off things we
watched a Tig Notaro standup on Netflix. I barely made it through without
falling asleep. I slept like a rock that night.</p>

<h3>Monday, 11 June 2018</h3>

<p>On Monday morning around 8A.M. Price and I were sitting on the porch swing. The
emergency personnel were just getting started for the day. The helicopter was
circling the lake when the pilot spotted him floating. We watched the boats -
two pontoon boats for the divers, a few DNR boats - all converge very quickly.
Sheriff Hancock walked up towards us and, giving a thumbs-up, told us they&rsquo;d
found him. He walked Jason to a neighbor&rsquo;s dock where the wife and other family
were waiting.</p>

<p>The helicopter landed in a nearby yard. The boats slowly made their way back
towards our dock. Holding on to the front of one of the pontoon boats were two
divers in the water. They were holding onto an orange bag. The coroner showed up
and backed his truck to the steps that lead down to our dock. The divers carried
him out of the water and onto our dock, then up to the coroner.</p>

<p>The divers packed and cleaned our dock. The coroner drove away. The Sheriff
walked up and thanked us for the use of our yard and dock.</p>

<p>In no more than an hour the pickup trucks and the SUVs were gone. The
Sheriff&rsquo;s Command Center RV was gone. The police tape was taken down. The family
left. The boats drove away.</p>

<p>Price and I walked down to our dock for the first time since Saturday. We moved
the fenders back to the side of the dock. I put my hammock back up and laid in
it for a while.</p>

<p>The man was a body builder. He was around 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; 250lbs, all muscle. It took less
than a minute for him to go under. There was nothing Price and I, or anyone
else, could have done. The people on the two boats that met them did everything
they could have.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the water, please have a life jacket available - one that is fitted
to your body size. Learn to swim. Learn to tread water. Learn to float.
Understand how quickly this could happen to even the strongest person.</p>

<p>Later in the week Price and I were in Florida to celebrate our niece&rsquo;s sixth
birthday. We went out on a friend&rsquo;s boat with six kids and three other adults.
It was our first time on the water since this whole experience. The kids all had
life jackets on, and there were enough on the boat for the adults. I found
myself double checking, even though I&rsquo;d been out on this boat with these people
before and it probably hadn&rsquo;t crossed my mind. Having grown up around boats and
on the water, these things are second-nature to me. We had a lovely time.</p>

<p>The water will always be a part of my life. It makes me happy and calm. I feel
most relaxed and peaceful when I&rsquo;m swimming or sailing or on a beach. Last
weekend I was reminded of the power of water. I&rsquo;ll never take it for granted
again.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m Taking a Year Off</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/im-taking-a-year-off</link>
      <description>I left my job writing software at The New York Times to travel for a year.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is my last day at The New York Times. Working here for the last two years
has been the most incredible experience of my career up to this point. I have
learned so much, I have grown as a person and as an engineer, and I have worked
with the best damn team that I could have asked for. I will miss you all
greatly.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I get to start an adventure that I have wanted to go on for many years.
I&rsquo;ve waited for this, preparing financially and professionally for the day that
I would feel comfortable leaving a steady income and jumping into a big unknown.
I will be traveling for most of the year with few concrete plans, which is
exciting and scary and I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along I will be posting regular updated here and on my
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianfoshee/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCnxocnbh74guQll8yqWGUA">YouTube</a> accounts!</p>

      <title>Japan Day 10 - Flying Home</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/last-day-japan</link>
      <description>Day 10 of the trip was the last day we were in Japan.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 10 of the trip was the last day we were in Japan. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/YRIYokhl6cc">watch the video
on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Our Airbnb hosts had a lovely breakfast prepared for us when we woke up.</p>

<p>James had to leave super early that morning, but Nicole, Paul, and I decided to
go into Tokyo one last time to see the Imperial Palace and eat lunch. The palace
was closed but we got to walk around the grounds.</p>

<p>We then got on the Narita Express train to take us to the airport. I said
goodbye to Nicole (who I would see the next day because we&rsquo;re roommates) and
Paul and headed to Terminal 2 for my flight back to NYC.</p>

<p>This is the final video of the Japan 2017 Series! Look forward to a lot more
travel content to come later this summer, as I&rsquo;m leaving my job this week to
start a new adventure.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 9 - Chiba</title>

      <description>On day 9 of the trip we headed back near Tokyo for our last night in Japan.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day 9 of the trip we headed back near Tokyo for our last night in Japan. You
can <a href="https://youtu.be/5bHAjetOe3E">watch the video on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Our bullet train left Osaka Station at 1:43PM and we arrived in Tokyo around
5PM. We then headed to our Airbnb in Chiba, which is on the north side of Tokyo
and closer to Narita Airport, which we&rsquo;d all be going to the next day.</p>

<p>The house we stayed in was a lovely traditional Japanese home where a family of
three lived. The mother and daughter were learning English together, and one of
the ways they practiced was by giving guests a tour of their house.</p>

<p>We headed out to find dinner, but on a week night this far outside of Tokyo most
places were closing early. We ended up in a mall that was eerily empty but had
some snack food to try out. For dinner we of course chose the place that spoke
zero english, and google translate wasn&rsquo;t much help. The meal ended up being
really good though.</p>

<p>Afterwards we walked in the rain to an American bar which was run by a
Japanese-speaking Persian man. At the bar we watched the movie Bartender
starring Tom Cruise, and enjoyed our last night in Japan.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/last-day-japan">day ten of the trip</a>: we leave our Airbnb and head into Tokyo one last
time, before making our way to the airport to fly home.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 8 - Eating Okonomiyaki in Osaka</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/ferris-wheel-okonomiyaki-osaka-japan</link>
      <description>On day 8 we travelled to Osaka and ate okonomiyaki.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day 8 we travelled to Osaka, where we ate the most delicious meal of the trip
and also rode on a ferris wheel. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/tgniqOzwgHg">watch the video on my YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

<p>We left at 11A.M. to head to Kyoto Station. Our Japan Rail train left at noon,
and the trip to Osaka was about 30 minutes long.</p>

<p>After arriving we made our way to our Airbnb, then Nicole and I went out to get
massages. We had to make appointments for later in the day, so we wandered
around a pet store in the meantime.</p>

<p>We all then met at a restaurant for dinner. We chose a place that served
okonomiyaki, which is a grilled pancake / omelette from heaven. The restaurant
had a map where customers could pin where they were from.</p>

<p>After dinner we went to ride on a ferris wheel!</p>

<p>Brandi then left for Thailand, so we said goodbye to her and then went back to
our Airbnb to do laundry.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/chiba-tokyo-japan">day nine of the trip</a>: we take yet another train ride, and stay with a
family for our final night in Japan.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 7 - Part 2: Shrines in Kyoto</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/kiyomizu-dera-fushimi-inari-shrines-kyoto-japan</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the second half of day seven we visited two shrines in Kyoto. You can
<a href="https://youtu.be/-qooMfJXTLU">watch the video on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Before getting to the shrines, Nicole and I went in search of an afternoon meal.
Most restaurants close between 2 and 5P.M., so all we could find was a cafe that
had some alright spaghetti.</p>

<p>The first shrine, Kiyomizu-dera, was under renovation so we could only see part
of it.</p>

<p>All of the the buses were packed on account of it being tourist season, so we
decided to take a taxi to the next shrine. That shrine, Fushimi-inari, is famous
for having thousands of gates winding through trails in the woods. The cicada
bugs were really loud here too.</p>

<p>Afterwards we tried to get into a fancy restaurant but it required reservations,
so nicole and I split off to get tacos while Brandi, James, and Paul went to eat
at a hotpot restaurant.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We began day seven of the trip eating street food at Nishiki Market in Kyoto.
All of us tried some interesting food, and we wandered around the little shops
in the market as well. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/nRMu-3clHCY">watch the video on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Nicole tried a fried octopus ball and did not enjoy it. Paul was very
adventurous and tried just about everything.</p>

<p>After we&rsquo;d had our fill we all got ice cream or slushies then went back to our
Airbnb to take naps around 2. When we woke up we were hungry for a full meal but
unfortunately most restaurants close at 2 and open again at 5. Nicole and I went
to find a cafe that might be open. We found a place that had some okay spaghetti
which held us over for a while.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 6 - Hiking (near) Mount Fuji</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/hiking-mount-fuji-japan</link>
      <description>On day six of the trip we hiked to a waterfall near mount fuji and then traveled to Kyoto.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day six of the trip we hiked to a waterfall near mount fuji and then traveled
to Kyoto. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/J_1qWqCgVxs">watch the video on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>We woke up at 4:15A.M. to watch the sunrise, because we were told that it is the
best time to see Mount Fuji before the clouds roll in.</p>

<p>After eating breakfast, we packed our bags and left them in the front office of
our villa. We needed to store them for a few hours while we went on a hike to a
local shrine and waterfall. The shrine was a 15 minute walk from our villa, and
the waterfall was a 30 minute hike from there.</p>

<p>After cooling down at the waterfall, we decided to walk down the road that led
back to where we started instead of taking the trail down. We also met a solo
traveler from Luxembourg who hung out with us for a few hours.</p>

<p>When we got down to the road we were pretty hungry so we found a place to eat
lunch. We were told to try the local Yoshida Udon Noodle which is only available
in this area. It did not disappoint.</p>

<p>We then got caught in a downpour, so our villa was nice enough to send a van to
pick us up and take us to the bus stop so we could make our way to Kyoto.</p>

<p>The 3:20P.M. bus ride was about 45 minutes long, and took us to Mishima station
where we got on a bullet train. This bullet train ride would be our first on the
trip. The train ride was a couple of hours long, and we got to Kyoto around
8P.M.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 5 - Leaving Tokyo</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/leaving-tokyo-japan</link>
      <description>On day five of our trip we leave Tokyo and travel to Mount Fuji!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On day five of our trip we leave Tokyo and travel to Mount Fuji! You can <a href="https://youtu.be/II3IYlsGllo">watch
the video on my YouTube channel</a>.  It took us most of the day, and a few
trains, to get there, but the views of the countryside were worth it.</p>

<p>To get out of Tokyo, we first took the local subway to Shinjuku station, where
we got on a Japan Rail train at 1:30PM. This train took us about an hour outside
of the city to Otsuki station.</p>

<p>Once we arrived at Otsuki station, we waited for our 3:15PM train towards
Kawaguchiko station. This trip took about an hour as well, and we made many
local stops while passing through smaller towns along the way.</p>

<p>At Kawaguchiko station, a van from our hotel was waiting to pick us up. When we
got in the van, we were informed that we were being taken to a supermarket, and
that we had 30 minutes to buy groceries for dinner and breakfast. Apparently,
the few restaurants that were nearby closed early and opened late. The
supermarket was a godsend because they had real peanut butter!</p>

<p>After we unpacked everything at our villa, we walked across the street to Lake
Kawaguchiko. Typically the clouds part after sunset, unveiling Mount Fuji, so we
waited by the lake and took in the scenery.</p>

<p>We got back to our villa after dark and made dinner. I believe it was some sort
of burrito / stir-fry hybrid. We also found out that we&rsquo;d accidentally bought
alcohol-free beer. Oops.</p>

<p>After dinner we played cards, then went to the hot spring baths at our hotel.
There were separate rooms for men and women, and we had to get naked and take a
shower before getting in. Apparently the water was directly from the lake, and
meant to have healing powers.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/hiking-mount-fuji-japan">day six of the trip</a>: we hike to a waterfall, we leave Mount Fuji, and
we ride on our first bullet train!</p>

      <title>Japan Day 4 - Tokyo SkyTree</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/tokyo-skytree-japan</link>
      <description>On the fourth day of the trip I met up with my cousin who was also in Japan, and we went to Tokyo Skytree.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the fourth day of the trip I met up with my cousin who was also in Japan, and
we went to Tokyo Skytree. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/z0569hrmPpQ">watch the video on my YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

<p>Day four was our last full day in Tokyo. We took it easy since the next morning
we were leaving for Mt Fuji. My cousin Lauren and I met up and spent part of the
day together. She wanted to check out Shibuya Crossing so we went back there. We
then got lost trying to find the sushi restaurant the rest of the group was at,
but eventually made it.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon wandering around the Imperial Palace (which was closed)
and running into a popup Oktoberfest, before heading to the Tokyo SkyTree Tower
to get a birds eye view of the city at night. Tokyo SkyTree was pretty neat, and
showed how huge a city Tokyo is. I&rsquo;d be interested to check that view out during
the day.</p>

<p>After saying goodbye to Lauren, I headed back to the house. Unfortunately I
didn&rsquo;t get any video, but we then went to a local bar for a couple of hours. We
had a very fun conversation with the bartender and another guy there, using
their bit of english, James&rsquo; bit of Japanese, and a lot of assistance from
Google Translate. It was a great evening.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/leaving-tokyo-japan">day five of the trip</a>, we leave Tokyo and make our way to Mt. Fuji!</p>

      <title>Japan Day 3 - Shinjuku, Shibuya, Sumida</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/shinjuku-shibuya-sumida-tokyo-japan</link>
      <description>On our third day in Tokyo we attend the Shinjuku Eisa Matsuri Festival, walk around the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, walk through Shibuya Crossing, and see the Sumida River Fireworks.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our third day in Tokyo we attend the Shinjuku Eisa Matsuri Festival, walk
around the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, walk through Shibuya Crossing, and
see the Sumida River Fireworks. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/mczzVb9uYI4">watch the video on my YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

<p>I woke up around 8AM today, so I got a lot of sleep. I was still laying in bed
at 9:15AM, and everyone else is pretty tired as well. We have two festivals to
go to today so we are taking it easy this morning. We left around noon to go
towards the Shinjuku festival. We hung around there for an hour or so watching
the drum and dance performances. It was possibly the hottest day of the trip,
and incredibly humid, so we only lasted so long in the crowds.</p>

<p>To cool off we headed to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. I bought a lemonade
for 350 yen and we got in for 200 yen. We walked around for an hour or so,
before heading to Shibuya Crossing, one of the busiest intersections in the
world. We stopped in the Starbucks that has a view of the crossing from above so
we could take some video. There&rsquo;s a timelapse in the video I linked at the
beginning of this post.</p>

<p>In the afternoon some rain set in so we went to find some food. I didn&rsquo;t realize
how long it&rsquo;d been since I&rsquo;d last eaten so I was getting a little out of it and
rather hangry. We found a nice place though and the noodles and shrimp hit the
spot.</p>

<p>Newly energized, we walked to the Sumida River Fireworks Festival. Sort of. We
walked down a street next to the park the fireworks were at because there were
so many people. There was zero standing room, and the police were making sure
nobody stood in the street so we had to keep walking. It also was raining on us.
When we left we had to walk past one subway station because there was a mob of
people trying to get into it.</p>

<p>We went to Ropongi Hills for dinner. Turns out it&rsquo;s a really expensive area so
we went to a German place. I got a beer and pesto German noodles with smoked
salmon. We headed home around 11PM.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/tokyo-skytree-japan">day four of the trip</a> I meet up with my cousin and we check out Tokyo
SkyTree.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 2 - Akihabara, Tokyo</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/akihabara-tokyo-japan</link>
      <description>On the second day of the trip we explored Akihabara, Tokyo, The Miraikan Science Museum, and Rainbow Bridge.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the second day of the trip we explored Akihabara, Tokyo, The Miraikan Science
Museum, and Rainbow Bridge. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/2dHKidesfeA">watch the video on my YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

<p>We left around 10AM to make our way towards Akihabara. Our first
stop was a giant 6 story arcade. It was loud, smelled like cigarettes (smoking
is still allowed indoors in Japan), and dark because there weren&rsquo;t any windows.
We walked through all of the floors, and some of the group tried out a game or
two.</p>

<p>After wandering around some more we ended up at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_café">Maid Cafe</a>. It
wasn&rsquo;t lunch time yet so I had a waffle with ice cream. They didn&rsquo;t allow
filming so we couldn&rsquo;t get video or pictures. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand the Maid
Cafe thing, but James and Paul went back later in the trip and had more
authentic experience. Our next stop was the Don Quixote, a multi-story
Walmart-type store that has tiny aisles and anything you could need.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d had our fix of the area, so we took a driverless monorail over
a bridge and to The Miraikan Science Museum. On our way over we saw people
dressed up in Mario character costumes driving go-karts down the street. At the
museum we saw a demo of Asimo, Honda&rsquo;s robot that can walk, kick a ball, and hop
on one leg, among other things.</p>

<p>When we left the museum we saw that we were near a BMW driving
experience course so we stopped to watch people drive cars around cones. It
seemed rather lame, or the drivers were timid. From there we walked to a mall to
sit inside and relax because it was really hot and humid outside.</p>

<p>After spending an hour or two at the mall we regrouped and made our
way to Rainbow Bridge. When we got there it wasn&rsquo;t lit up, and an internet
search told us that it only lights up during a certain time of year. We did,
however, sit on the beach and enjoy a nice view of the Tokyo skyline and a lot
of really colorful boats out on the water.</p>

<p>At this point it was way past dinner time so we went to a ramen
place then made our way home. I picked up some bananas at the supermarket across
the street from our house, dumped my camera card onto my computer, and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>On <a href="/blog/shinjuku-shibuya-sumida-tokyo-japan">day three of the trip</a> we attend a couple of festivals.</p>

      <title>Japan Day 1 - Ueno, Tokyo</title>
      <link>https://www.brianfoshee.com/blog/ueno-tokyo-japan</link>
      <description>On the first full day of the trip, James, Brandi, and I explored Ueno, Tokyo while waiting for Nicole and Paul to arrive.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the first full day of the trip, James, Brandi, and I explored Ueno, Tokyo
while waiting for Nicole and Paul to arrive. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/zp5WOnUz89M">watch the video on my
YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>After waking up at 5AM local time and being unable to fall back asleep, I put on
my eye mask and laid in bed for a couple of hours. After we all decided that
sleep wasn&rsquo;t going to happen, we left our Airbnb around 9AM to head to the Ueno
Zoo. The train/subway ride was 30-45 minutes.</p>

<p>The Ueno Zoo is in a massive park with a museum, a few shrines, some statues,
and the biggest standalone Starbucks I&rsquo;ve ever seen. We primarily went to the
zoo to waste time while waiting on Nicole and Paul to arrive later in the day,
but we were also there to see the giant panda. Along with the panda we saw a
polar bear, tiger, elephants, birds, and gorillas.</p>

<p>After the zoo we wandered around the area for a bit, stopping by a shrine. We
then made our way to get lunch at Cocoichiban, a chain curry restaurant. I
ordered the vegetarian curry with spinach and eggplant, and a scrambled egg.
Spicy level 2.</p>

<p>From there we walked to a nearby lotus pond that was at least 5 acres in size if
not larger. It had a floating dock which we could walk out onto that was
surrounded by lotuses. We spent some time there, still waiting on Nicole and
Paul to land, then headed to see Tokyo Dome City. On our way there we stopped by
another shrine.</p>

<p>Tokyo Dome City was FULL of k-pop fans. I think there was a signing or something
to get ready for upcoming concerts, but people were lined up for autographs or
pictures in what looked like at least a two hour line. After spending an hour or
so people watching, we walked to Tokyo Station to meet Paul and Nicole!</p>

<p>We walked around some fountains near the Imperial Palace, then headed back to
our Airbnb to drop bags off. After hanging out for a bit we set out looking for
dinner. I was getting really tired at this point but was also hungry. It was
probably 6PM or 7PM.</p>

<p>It took us probably 30 minutes to find somewhere to eat. We passed another
shrine that we walked through, then landed at a local spot where they spoke zero
English. We used the Google Translate app to sorta read the menu but that didn&rsquo;t
work. Luckily the waiter knew salmon, tuna, octopus, and sashimi so we ordered
those roles and a sashimi plate.</p>

<p>I was fighting off falling asleep at this point, but we made it back to the apt.
I dumped the footage from that day onto my computer and then fell asleep
immediately.</p>
