Today is my last day at The New York Times. Working here for the last two years
has been the most incredible experience of my career up to this point. I have
learned so much, I have grown as a person and as an engineer, and I have worked
with the best damn team that I could have asked for. I will miss you all
greatly.

Tomorrow I get to start an adventure that I have wanted to go on for many years.
I've waited for this, preparing financially and professionally for the day that
I would feel comfortable leaving a steady income and jumping into a big unknown.
I will be traveling for most of the year with few concrete plans, which is
exciting and scary and I can't wait.

If you want to follow along I will be posting regular updated here and on my
[Instagram][ig] and [YouTube][yt] accounts!
